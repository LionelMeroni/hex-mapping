# The Post-Apocalyptic table
# Written by Josh Johnston and Alex Schroeder

;TOP
1,These are the lands of the post-apocalypse.
# TODO: add global threats and powers to the introduction.

;forest
1,The trees of the *[name for forest]* surround you and grow towards the sun in tight spirals. [forest people]
1,The *[name for forest]* is quiet except for the sound of two mutated animals ripping each other apart.
1,Strange looking birds call out high above the trees of the *[name for forest]*.
1,An occasional eye stalk pokes through the mounds beneath the towering trees of the *[name for forest]*.

;desert
1,A lizard as large as an Old Earth automobile basks in the unrelenting sun of the *[name for desert]*.<p>[desert people]
1,The *[name for desert]* sun bakes you to the point of blacking out.<p>[desert people]
1,Tall orange cactus slowly creep along the *[name for desert]* floor in search of food.<p>[desert people]

;mountain
1,The fresh mountain air up in the *[name for mountain]* is a nice change from the smell of burning mutants and androids.
1,You are surrounded by the steep peaks of the *[name for mountain]* in all directions. The going will be difficult.
1,The air of the *[name for mountain]* is cold and thin. It's getting harder and harder to catch your breath. What could possibly survive up here?
1,The slopes up the the *[name for mountain]* are steep and the trails are slippery with ice and slush. It's impossible to tell if you're walking on bones or thin ice.

;jungle
1,The extreme humidity of the *[name for jungle]* makes breathing difficult, but has the added benefit of disabling most robots.
1,The *[name for jungle]* seems to be extra hostile today.

;swamp
1,The foul smelling quicksand of the *[name for swamp]* pulls at your feet.
1,The tidal quicksand of the *[name for swamp]* reveals an android graveyard.
1,Mutated *[colour]* frogs crunch beneath your feet as you slog through the *[name for swamp]*.
1,The *[name for swamp]* reeks of dead bodies and ruin. Unknown creatures shriek in the distance.

;grass
1,The *[name for grass]* grasses hum with a radioactive intensity. [grass people]
1,There seems to be no end to the *[name for grass]*. [grass people]
1,The *[name for grass]* stretches in all directions. Large buzzing insects hover menacingly.
1,Two meter tall crickets chew the rainbow grass contentedly. This is the *[name for grass]*.

;ruin
1,Piles of ash are all that remain where a small town once stood. Partial skeletons are scattered indiscriminately.
1,Multiple craters litter the landscape. It's impossible to tell what once stood here.
1,A partially standing library smoulders in the distance. The bookshelves poke through the crumbled masonry like old bones.
1,A wreck of a gas station lies in several burning piles. The underground tanks have been long siphoned dry.
1,What was an airport once stood here. Craters both large and small have shattered the runway. The control tower is still intact although leaning heavily to one side.
1,Large parts of planes litter the ground. Animal hides hang over the entrances on the remaining fuselages of the Old Earth machines. A humanoid hangs from the control tower as a warning.
1,The scorch marks on the battered concrete slab are all that remain of this starport. Was this a place to travel to the stars or to escape the Cataclysm?
1,A sign on the corner of a burned out brick building points to a bomb shelter up ahead. You hope you can reach it before the radioactive rains start again.
1,The ruins of a sprawling hospital complex cover several acres. There are rumours that medical supplies as well as mutant horrors can still be found inside.
1,This ancient manufacturing city covers several square miles. The sounds of machinery echo from some of the larger buildings. Have the robots been running their programs since the Cataclysm?

;fort
1,<p>An old Police station has been repurposed into a crumbling shelter. Several figures can be seen moving through the shadows. There is a large laser weapon on the roof. [fort people]
1,<p>A collapsing crater hides an entrance to a well fortified station. [fort people]

;cave
1,<p>There is a hidden cave entrance barely big enough to squeeze into. The smell is overpowering and impossible to identify. [cave people]
1,<p>There’s an entrance to one of the old radiation shelters, here. This cave system stretches for many hundreds of meters in different directions. It looks to have been abandoned long ago. [cave people]

# Caves

;cave people
1,The [1d6x10] **morlocks** ([morlock stats]) living in these caves have no access to the deeper levels. All they seek is shelter from the elements and a defensible home. At night, they emerge from the underground to do their hunting and gathering. [morlock witch]<p>[morlock trouble]
1,The [3d6] **vat people** ([human stats]) living in these caves have gained access to bio-genesis labs and have used them for self-improvement. The chief [scientist|grower|lab master|bio wizard|genetic improviser] *[here human fancy name as scientist]* is in charge of the research program. It requires a lot of organic base material from the surface.<p>[vat people servants]<p>[vat people trouble]

;vat people servants
1,The vat people are served by [6d6] of **weaker morlocks** – siblings the elders judged to be “unfit” for lab work ([human stats]). It’s a terribly unjust society and if you spend any amount of time in the labs, or if you manage to catch one of them on their material gathering expeditions, they’ll beg for your help. [“Please, free us from these eugenitocracy!”|“Help us topple the genetic purists!”]
1,The vat people are served by [6d6] **plantoids** ([plantoid stats]). They are mobile, mute, appear to be totally subservient. If you can communicate with them telepathically, however, you’ll soon discover that they often squirrel away nutrients and have an entire *hidden* community of [3d6x10] mobile plantoids living in the canals and sewers below the lab. Revolution is brewing, down there…

;plantoid stats
1,TODO

;vat people trouble
1,Sadly, the vat solutions have contracted some sort of infection. *[same scientist]* says that *[nearby scientist]* might be able to help. [“Will you go and ask them to come and have a look?”|“I know would hate coming. Can’t you just go and kidnap them?”|“Here’s a tube of [tube content] to give them in exchange for their coming.”]

;vat people problems
1,A swarm of acid worms have eaten into the n-field generator. With the n-field generator down, the vat people's body banks are left unprotected.
1,The vat banks have not been sterilized in a lunar cycle because of a nesting dirt devil. If the dirt devil can be killed or captured, the eggs can be harvested and the vats resterilized.
1,The entrances to the vat people's caves have been blocked due to the annual migration of the incredibly aggressive and frighteningly poisonous cactoids. If we could lure the cactoids away with their favorite food, the vat people would reward us with free healing and DNA splicing.
1,The vat people's long time enemies, the nuclear wizards, have raided and stolen data integral to the body bank's manufacturing process. Perhaps with the help of the vat people's mobile AI station, we could hack into the nuclear wizard's matrix, reroute the subroutine, and steal back the code.
1,The vat people's body banks have gone haywire, and are generating body parts with too many unsuitable mutations. Perhaps the knowledge of the Atom Gazers can help the vat people reprogram their AI loop?
