# The Post-Apocalyptic table
# Written by Josh Johnston and Alex Schroeder

;forest
1,The trees surround you and grow towards the sun in tight spirals.
1,THe forest is quiet except for the sound of two mutated animals ripping each other apart.
1,Strange looking birds call out high above the trees.
1,An occasional eye stalk pokes through the mounds of pine needles.

;desert
1,A lizard as large as an Old Earth automobile basks in the unrelenting sun.
1,The desert sun bakes you to the point of blacking out.
1,Tall orange cactus slowly creep along the desert floor in search of food.
1,A dust devil spins in the distance with several humanoids inside.

;mountain
1,The fresh mountain air is a nice change from the smell of burning mutants and androids.
1,You are surrounded by steep peaks in all directions. The going will be difficult.
1,The air is cold and the atmosphere feels thin. It's getting harder and harder to catch your breath. You wonder what could possibly survive up here.
1,The climbing is steep and the trails are slippery with ice and slush. It's impossible to tell if you're walking on bones or thin ice.

;jungle
1,The extreme humidity makes breathing difficult, but has the added benefit of disabling most robots.
1,The jungle seems to be extra hostile today.

;swamp
1,The foul smelling quicksand pulls at your feet.
1,The tidal quicksand reveals an android graveyard.
1,Mutated frogs bright purple in color crunch beneath your feet.
1,The swamp reeks of dead bodies and ruin. Unknown creatures shriek in the distance.

;grass
1,The grasses hum with a radioactive intensity. [grass people]
1,There seems to be no end to the neon pink grasslands. [grass people]
1,Neon pink grass stretches in all directions. Large buzzing insects hover menacingly.
1,Two meter tall crickets chew the rainbow grass contentedly.

;ruin
1,Piles of ash are all that remain where a small town once stood. Partial skeletons are scattered indiscriminately.
1,Multiple craters litter the landscape. It's impossible to tell what once stood here.
1,A partially standing library smolders in the distance. The bookshelves poke through the crumbled masonry like old bones.
1,A wreck of a gas station lies in several burning piles. The underground tanks have been long siphoned dry.
1,What was an airport once stood here. Craters both large and small have shattered the runway. The control tower is still intact although leaning heavily to one side.
1,Large parts of planes litter the ground. Animal hides hang over the entrances on the remaining fuselages of the Old Earth machines. A humanoid hangs from the control tower as a warning.
1,The scorch marks on the battered concrete slab are all that remain of this Starport. Was this a place to travel to the stars or to escape the Cataclysm?
1,A sign on the corner of a burned out brick building points to a bomb shelter up ahead. You hope you can reach it before the radioactive rains start again.
1,The ruins of a sprawling hospital complex cover several acres. There are rumors that medical supplies as well as mutant horrors can still be found inside.
1,This ancient manufacturing city covers several square miles. The sounds of machinery echo from some of the larger buildings. Have the robots been running their programs since the Cataclysm?

;fort
1,An old Police station has been repurposed into a crumbling shelter. Several figures can be seen moving through the shadows. There is a large laser weapon on the roof.
1,A collapsing crater hides an entrance to a well fortified station.

;cave
1,The cave entrance is barely big enough to squeeze into. The smell is overpowering and impossible to identify.
1,This cave system stretches for many hundreds of meters in different directions. It looks to have been abandoned long ago. Hopefully the radiation levels aren't as high underground.
