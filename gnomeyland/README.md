# Gnomeyland Icons

The SVG file in this directory contains the Gnomeland icons drawn by
Gregory B. MacKenzie. They used to be hosted on busygamemaster.com but
they seem to be gone, now. These were used to create the
[gnomeyland.txt](../contrib/gnomeyland.txt) file for [Text
Mapper](..#text-mapper).
